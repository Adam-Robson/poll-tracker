# Poll Tracker

See this repository live [here](adaam-poll-tracker.netlify.app).

## Description

This is a basic web application built when I was first learning web development. 

HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and Supabase combine to present a very simple interface where a user can enter the text to create a poll and two answers.  Both answer totals can be counted and the poll, with the answer totals can be saved.  When saved, it displays on the screen in the history section.

## Acknowledgements

This project was created as part of the curriculum during my participation at Alchemy Code Lab in Portland Oregon in 2022. The concept and the general guidelines were not original. The implementation, however, is original.
